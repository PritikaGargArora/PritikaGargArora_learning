## UdaGram Project- Pritika Garg Arora

Project will deploy the web application using Cloud Formation , where ask is to write the code that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for an Instagram-like app (UDAGRAM) from the ground up.

# Problem Details:
Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram. Developers pushed the latest version of their code in a zip file located in a public S3 Bucket.

# Resolution:
There will be two parts to this project:

1. A diagram to understand the CloudFormation script.



2. CloudFormation script
